# Incident

An open-source light-meter that reproduces the functionality of expensive tools, using a few inexpensive parts. There is a whisper of soldering involved in this but don't let that put you off.


# Background

An incident light-meter is an essential tool in photography. The sophisticated computation baked-in to modern cameras devotes a lot of effort guessing 'how much light is falling on the subject?". If you have the option of getting to the subject and taking a reading, everything becomes a lot easier.


# Hardware

- A Pi Pico                     
- A Rotary Encoder              (mode selection etc)
- A Mechanical Keyboard Switch  (to Trigger measurement)
- A Photodiode                  (fast and accurate measurement in case we end up writing code that is clever enough to measure studio flash)
- A Case              
- A LiPo Battery
