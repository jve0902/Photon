# Incident

An open-source light-meter that reproduces the functionality of expensive tools, using a few inexpensive parts.


# Background

An incident light-meter is an essential tool in photography. The sophisticated computation baked-in to modern cameras devotes a lot of effort guessing 'how much light is falling on the subject?". If you have the option of getting to the subject and taking a reading, everything becomes a lot easier.


# Hardware

- A Pi Pico. The people at Pimoroni have `uf2` files for the Pico that has all the modules you'll need
- A Pimoroni BH1745 Luminance and Colour Sensor Breakout
- A Rotarty Encoder
- An OLED Screen
