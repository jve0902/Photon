# Cases

A place for the printable files to make your own case. Feel free to contribute your own designs/ refinements by [forking the respository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo). If possible, supplement your files with photos of how the internals fit together. Each design is listed as a subdirectory

**NB** The file `Original` is only usable with some filing of corners of the pcb that the OLED screen fits onto. Enthusiasm for a frame meant some measurements were overlooked.
