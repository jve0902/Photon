# Large Case for Photon

Design based on the first case with cutouts for a rotary encoder, a tactile button and the light sensor on top. It has room for all of the cables, a frame on the bottom for the Pico to snap into and a 2000 mAh battery. The screen can be secured to the lid with M2*12 screws and nuts. The case also has a screwdriver slot for easy lid opening.
